      <h4 class="blue-text">Understanding the Normal Distribution</h4>
      <p>
        Hey there! Today, we're going to explore the fascinating world of the normal distribution. It's like a magical shape that appears in many aspects of our lives. Picture this: you have a group of friends, and you measure their heights. If you were to plot all their heights on a graph, it would create a special curve that's wider in the middle and narrows towards the edges. This curve is what we call the normal distribution.
      </p>
      <p>
        The normal distribution is unique because it helps us make sense of a bunch of data. In this case, most of your friends will be around the average height, which is the highest point on the curve. As you move away from the average towards the tall and short ends, the number of friends becomes smaller. This means that extreme heights, like really tall or really short friends, are less common.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, let's talk about two special friends: the Mean and the Standard Deviation. The Mean is like the superhero of the normal distribution. It's the average height of all your friends combined. The Standard Deviation, on the other hand, tells us how spread out your friends' heights are from the Mean. If your friends' heights are similar, the Standard Deviation will be small, and the curve will be narrow. But if their heights vary a lot, the Standard Deviation will be bigger, and the curve will be wider.

      <p>
        The normal distribution is super helpful in science, math, and many other fields. It allows scientists and researchers to understand patterns in data, make predictions, and solve all kinds of cool problems. So next time you see a bell-shaped curve or hear about the normal distribution, remember that it's like a secret code that helps us unlock the mysteries hidden in our data!

      <p>
        A Gaussian mixture model is a probabilistic model that assumes all the data points are generated from a
        mixture of a finite number of Gaussian distributions with unknown parameters. One can think of mixture
        models as generalizing k-means clustering to incorporate information about the covariance structure of the
        data as well as the centers of the latent Gaussians. More info
